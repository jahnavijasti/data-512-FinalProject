# World Unemployment Rate

## Introduction

People, educated and uneducated, who do not work and cannot earn enough for their own living, are called unemployed. The unemployment ratio of a country is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total number of people in the country. The motivation behind this analysis is to bring more in depth knowledge about unemployement in the world. We know that there is an effect of unemployment on any country, and this analysis gives insights of which countries need to focus more on employment oppourtunities.

## Why is this analysis important

High unemployment can have a negative impact on the country’s economic growth. It may also increase poverty, alcoholism, depression and suicide rate. This could be a great threat to humans. 
Hence, analyzing the unemployment data could give the government or the organizations a first idea on what is going on in the world, and what measures could be taken to decrease unemployment.

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to find 

•	Countries with highest rate of unemployment

•	Countries with increasing/decreasing rate of unemployment over the years

## Data

The unemployment rate data for each country is downloaded from World Bank Data, with an open license. 
	



The data contains the following columns:

• Country_Name:	Name of the country

• Country_Code:	Code id for each country

• Indicator_Name:	What kind of data this file contains (Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) )

• Indicator_Code:	Code for the indicator name

• 1960 to 2016:	Rate of unemployment


The file consists data for 265 countries from 1991 to 2016. Although there are columns for years from 1960 to 1990, there is no available data for these years. Hence, these columns will be deleted for the analysis.

## Expected Result

•	A visualization that show the countries with highest and lowest unemployment rate. 

•	A visualization that shows the rate of change of unemployment rate for each country.
